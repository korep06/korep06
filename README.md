## 👋 Hi there!

### I'm a beginner C++ developer with a passion for building cool stuff.

I'm 20 years old and currently studying at Saint Petersburg Electrotechnical University "LETI", majoring in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence.

Programming is my passion. I mostly work with C++, creating desktop applications using **Qt**. I also explore various technologies and tools to expand my skillset.
